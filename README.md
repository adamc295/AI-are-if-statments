# AI are if statments

AI is a wonderful thing. It can help us read the news, tell jokes, or even _play skyrim_.

However, the concept of AI is very hard to understand. It can involve complex maths, lots of googling, alot of "programming" (stealing from stack overflow), or involve alot of snakes.

So, a simpler way was invented. The `if` statment.

# Explanation of `if`
The `if` statment can be used for alot of things, but we will just be focusing on AI for now.

An example of AI is:

`if(emotion=angery){
	die();
	kill();
	// wait what
};`

This example is not a good one, but a diagram might help.

However, github doesn't like me.
